	//Arrays are nothing but store houses
	//Array is the collection of homogeneous data types
	//Array in java is object because of use of new keyword
	//Array extends Object Class which is the parent class of all the classes in Java
	//Array occupies memory in Heap Area
	
	//Advantages of Arrays
	//1. Arrays can store multiple values
	//2. Arrays are fast compared to primitive data types. 
	//3. Directly objects can be stored in an Array
	
	//Disadvantages of Arrays
	//1. Arrays ka size is fixed. It cannot be increased or decreased during runtime
	//2. Wastage of space
	//3. Arrays can store data of similar data type
	//4. In case we delete an element(s) from the middle of an array then the elements which follow will have to be traversed

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		//you are working in a school
		//1000 students
		
		int[] student_id = new int[100];
		
		//student_id is the integer array with a size 1000
		student_id[0] = 101;
